          Information our servers automatically collect when you access the Service, such as your IP
          address, browser type, operating system, access times, and the pages you have viewed directly

          When you interact with our blockchain-based insurance services, we collect information related to
          your blockchain transactions, including wallet addresses, transaction hashes, and smart contract
          interactions. This information is inherently public on the blockchain and is necessary for the
          operation of our insurance services.

        <p>
          Our Service utilizes blockchain technology to provide transparent and secure insurance services.
          It's important to understand the following aspects of blockchain data:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Public Nature of Blockchain</h3>
        <p>
          Blockchain networks are inherently public and transparent. When you interact with our
          blockchain-based insurance services, certain information such as wallet addresses, transaction
          amounts, and smart contract interactions are recorded on the blockchain and are publicly visible.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Immutability</h3>
        <p>
          Data recorded on the blockchain is immutable, meaning it cannot be altered or deleted. This
          includes transaction records and smart contract interactions related to your insurance policies.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Pseudonymity</h3>
        <p>
          While blockchain transactions are public, they are pseudonymous by default. Your personal identity
          is not directly linked to your blockchain transactions unless you have taken actions that connect
          your identity to your wallet address.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Off-Chain Data</h3>
        <p>
          To protect your privacy, we store sensitive personal information off-chain in secure, encrypted
          databases. Only necessary data for the execution of smart contracts is stored on the blockchain.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Zero-Knowledge Proofs</h3>
        <p>
          For certain types of insurance that require sensitive information, we may utilize zero-knowledge
          proof technology to verify information without revealing the underlying data on the blockchain.

        <p>We may share your information in the following situations:</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
        <p>
          We may share your information with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents
          who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that
          work. Examples include payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services,
          customer service, and marketing efforts.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Business Transfers</h3>
        <p>
          We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any
          merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to
          another company.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Affiliates</h3>
        <p>
          We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates
          to honor this Privacy Policy.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Business Partners</h3>
        <p>
          We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain products, services,
          or promotions.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">With Your Consent</h3>
        <p>We may disclose your personal information for any other purpose with your consent.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with
          applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such
          as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet
          national security or law enforcement requirements).
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Vital Interests and Legal Rights</h3>

          We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take
          action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving
          potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation

          technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,

          improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

          When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will
